# 🔧 Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## ✅ Fixes Applied

I've updated your configuration to fix common deployment issues:

1. ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to properly track directories
2. ✅ Created `.gitkeep` files for `flask_session/` and `static/uploads/`
3. ✅ Improved `Procfile` with better logging
4. ✅ Added `nixpacks.toml` for Railway-specific configuration
5. ✅ Ensured JSON files are tracked by git

## 📊 Check Your Railway Logs

**To see the exact error:**

1. Go to Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click on the **"Deployments"** tab
4. Click on the **failed deployment**
5. Look at **"Build Logs"** and **"Deploy Logs"**

## 🐛 Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gunicorn'"
**Fix:** Already fixed - gunicorn is in requirements.txt

### Error: "Application failed to start"
**Cause:** Port binding issue
**Fix:** Already fixed - using `$PORT` environment variable

### Error: "No such file or directory: 'flask_session'"
**Cause:** Directory not in git
**Fix:** Already fixed - added `.gitkeep` files

### Error: "Build failed" with Python errors
**Check:** 
- Make sure all Python files are valid
- No syntax errors
- All imports are in requirements.txt

### Error: "Permission denied"
**Cause:** File permissions
**Fix:** Railway handles this automatically, but make sure no sensitive files are in git

### Error: "Timeout" during build
**Cause:** Large dependencies
**Fix:** Already configured timeout to 120 seconds

### Error: "Static files not found"
**Check:**
- Make sure `templates/` folder is in git
- Make sure `static/` folder is in git
- Run: `git add templates/ static/` to ensure they're tracked

## 🚀 Re-Deploy After Fixes

### If using Git:

```bash
# Add all the fixes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"

# Push to trigger re-deployment
git push
```

### If using GitHub Desktop:

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. You'll see all changed files
3. Add commit message: "Fix Railway deployment"
4. Click "Commit to main"
5. Click "Push origin"

Railway will automatically re-deploy!

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Make sure these files exist and are committed:

- ✅ `app.py`
- ✅ `requirements.txt`
- ✅ `Procfile`
- ✅ `runtime.txt`
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml`
- ✅ `templates/index.html`
- ✅ `static/script.js`
- ✅ `static/style.css`
- ✅ `static/atlas_ai.js`
- ✅ `flask_session/.gitkeep`
- ✅ `static/uploads/.gitkeep`

## 🔍 Verify Files Are in Git

Run these commands to check:

```bash
# See what files are tracked
git ls-files

# Make sure templates and static are there
git ls-files | grep -E "templates|static"
```

## 💡 Alternative: Smaller Configuration

If deployment still fails, try this minimal Procfile:

```
web: python app.py
```

Update in Railway:
1. Go to project Settings
2. Add environment variable: `PORT` = `8080`
3. Redeploy

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Option 1: Share the error logs
Copy the error from Railway logs and share it - I can help debug!

### Option 2: Try a clean deployment

```bash
# Make sure everything is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Clean Railway deployment"
git push

# In Railway, click "Redeploy" button
```

### Option 3: Check Railway status

## ✅ Verification Steps

Once deployed successfully:

1. **Homepage loads** - Should see the dashboard
2. **Check logs** - Should see "Starting ATLAS - Singapore OpenStreetMap Monitor (Production)"
3. **Test features:**
   - Map view loads
   - List view shows changesets
   - Atlas AI responds
   - Filters work

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Add all files to git** (if not already done)
2. **Commit and push** to trigger re-deployment
3. **Check Railway logs** to see if it works
4. **Share any errors** if it still fails - I'm here to help!
