# 🚨 Railway "Railpack could not determine how to build" - FIXED

## ❌ The Error You Saw:
```
Script start.sh not found
Railpack could not determine how to build the app
```

## ✅ What I Fixed:

1. **Removed `railway.toml`** - It was causing conflicts
2. **Simplified `nixpacks.toml`** - Cleaner Python detection
3. **Simplified `Procfile`** - Just the essential gunicorn command
4. **Added `.python-version`** - Helps Railway detect Python 3.11

## 🚀 Deploy Now:

### Push these fixes to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway build detection"
git push
```

**Or with GitHub Desktop:**
1. Commit message: "Fix Railway build detection"
2. Click "Commit" then "Push"

## 🎯 What Will Happen:

Railway will now:
1. ✅ Detect it's a Python 3.11 app
2. ✅ Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. ✅ Start with `gunicorn` from the `Procfile`
4. ✅ Your app will be live in 2-3 minutes!

## ⏱️ Expected Deployment Time:

- Build: ~2 minutes
- Deploy: ~30 seconds
- **Total: ~2.5 minutes**

## 🔍 Watch the Logs:

In Railway dashboard:
1. Click your project
2. Go to "Deployments"
3. Watch the new deployment build
4. Look for: ✅ "Starting ATLAS - Singapore OpenStreetMap Monitor (Production)"

## ✅ Success Indicators:

You'll know it worked when you see:
```
==> Installing dependencies
==> pip install -r requirements.txt
==> Starting application
==> web: gunicorn app:app
==> Server started on port 8080
```

## 💡 Why This Happened:

- Railway saw `start.sh` and tried to use it
- Multiple config files confused Railway's auto-detection
- Now it's clean with just: Procfile + nixpacks.toml + Python version

## 🎉 Next Steps:

1. **Commit and push** (commands above)
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Railway to rebuild
3. **Check your Railway URL** - it should work!
4. **Share the URL** with your team!
