## 📐 Technical Details

### Calculation:
```
New size = Original size × 0.8
```

### Examples:
```css
/* Before */
body { font-size: 13px; }
h2 { font-size: 0.9rem; }
.badge { font-size: 0.7rem; }

/* After */
body { font-size: 10.4px; }
h2 { font-size: 0.72rem; }
.badge { font-size: 0.56rem; }
```

### Method:

- Applied 20% reduction (multiplied by 0.8)
- Maintained proper decimal precision
- Preserved all other CSS properties

new_value = current_value * 1.25
```

Or restore from backup:
- 13px was the original body font-size
- 1rem was the original large heading size
- 0.85rem was the original button size
