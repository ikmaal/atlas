# 🇸🇬 Singapore Changeset Filtering - Fix Documentation

## 🐛 Problem

The dashboard was showing changesets from **other countries** in addition to Singapore changesets. This happened because the OpenStreetMap API's `bbox` parameter returns any changeset that **overlaps** with the bounding box, even if the changeset has edits outside Singapore.

### Why This Happened:
- OSM API returns changesets that **touch** the Singapore bounding box
- A changeset could have 99% of edits in Malaysia and 1% in Singapore
- Those changesets would still show up in our dashboard

## ✅ Solution

Added a **geographic filtering system** that:
1. Checks each changeset's bounding box
2. Calculates the **center point** of the changeset
3. Only includes changesets whose center is **within Singapore's borders**

### How It Works:

```python
# Calculate changeset center point
center_lat = (bbox['min_lat'] + bbox['max_lat']) / 2
center_lon = (bbox['min_lon'] + bbox['max_lon']) / 2

# Check if center is in Singapore
is_within = (
    103.59 <= center_lon <= 104.05 and  # Longitude range
    1.15 <= center_lat <= 1.48           # Latitude range
)
```

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Added Singapore Coordinates** (`app.py`)
```python
SINGAPORE_BBOX_COORDS = {
    'min_lon': 103.59,
    'min_lat': 1.15,
    'max_lon': 104.05,
    'max_lat': 1.48
}
```

### 2. **Created Filter Function** (`app.py`)
```python
def is_changeset_in_singapore(changeset):
    """
    Check if a changeset is primarily within Singapore.
    Returns True if the changeset's center point is within Singapore bounds.
    """
    # Gets bbox, calculates center, checks if within bounds
    # Returns False if no bbox data or outside Singapore
```

### 3. **Applied Filter to All Endpoints**

#### Main Changesets API (`/api/changesets`)
```python
# Filter to only include changesets that are primarily within Singapore
total_fetched = len(changesets)
changesets = [cs for cs in changesets if is_changeset_in_singapore(cs)]
filtered_count = len(changesets)

print(f"Fetched {total_fetched} changesets from OSM API, {filtered_count} are in Singapore")
```

#### User Changesets API (`/api/user/changesets`)
```python
# Filter to only include changesets that are primarily within Singapore
changesets = [cs for cs in changesets if is_changeset_in_singapore(cs)]
```

#### User Profile Singapore Stats (`/api/profile/<username>/singapore-stats`)
```python
# Added bbox data to changeset parsing
# Filter to only include changesets that are primarily within Singapore
changesets = [cs for cs in changesets if is_changeset_in_singapore(cs)]
```

## 📊 Impact

### Before:
- ❌ Changesets from Malaysia, Indonesia, etc. showing up
- ❌ Inaccurate statistics for Singapore
- ❌ Confusing data for users

### After:
- ✅ **Only changesets centered in Singapore**
- ✅ Accurate statistics for Singapore region
- ✅ Clean, relevant data
- ✅ Better performance (fewer changesets to process)

## 🔍 Filtering Logic

### Included Changesets:
- ✅ Center point is within Singapore bounds (103.59-104.05°E, 1.15-1.48°N)
- ✅ Primary editing activity in Singapore

### Excluded Changesets:
- ❌ Center point is outside Singapore
- ❌ Missing bounding box data (can't determine location)
- ❌ Primary editing activity in other countries

## 📝 Example

### Scenario 1: Singapore-Only Changeset ✅
```
Changeset bbox: 
  min_lon: 103.75, max_lon: 103.85
  min_lat: 1.25, max_lat: 1.35

Center: (103.80, 1.30) → WITHIN Singapore → ✅ INCLUDED
```

### Scenario 2: Cross-Border Changeset ❌
```
Changeset bbox:
  min_lon: 103.55, max_lon: 104.10  (spans beyond Singapore)
  min_lat: 1.10, max_lat: 1.50      (spans beyond Singapore)

Center: (103.825, 1.30) → Could be in Singapore or outside

BUT if center calculation shows:
Center: (103.50, 1.30) → OUTSIDE Singapore → ❌ EXCLUDED
```

### Scenario 3: Malaysia Changeset ❌
```
Changeset bbox:
  min_lon: 103.50, max_lon: 103.58  (mostly in Malaysia)
  min_lat: 1.35, max_lat: 1.45

Center: (103.54, 1.40) → OUTSIDE Singapore (lon < 103.59) → ❌ EXCLUDED
```

## 🚀 Testing

After updating, you'll see in the console:
```
Fetched 250 changesets from OSM API, 187 are in Singapore, using 187 after limit
```

This shows:
- **Total fetched**: Changesets from OSM API
- **Filtered**: Only Singapore changesets
- **Final count**: Number displayed to users

## 📈 Expected Results

You should now see:
- ✅ All changesets on map are in Singapore
- ✅ List view shows only Singapore changesets
- ✅ User profiles show only Singapore activity
- ✅ Statistics reflect true Singapore data
- ✅ No more foreign country changesets

## 🔄 To Apply Changes

1. **Stop the Flask server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   py app.py
   ```
3. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Check console output** for filtering statistics

## 🎯 Validation

To verify it's working:
1. Look at changesets on the map
2. Check that all are within Singapore borders
3. Check console logs for filtering stats
4. Click on changesets to verify locations

## 📍 Singapore Bounding Box

```
Coordinates used for filtering:
- Longitude: 103.59°E to 104.05°E
- Latitude:  1.15°N to 1.48°N

This covers:
- Main island of Singapore
- Sentosa
- Pulau Ubin
- Pulau Tekong
- Southern islands
```

## 🎉 Summary

The dashboard now **accurately filters** changesets to show only those primarily within Singapore's borders. No more foreign country changesets! 🇸🇬✨
