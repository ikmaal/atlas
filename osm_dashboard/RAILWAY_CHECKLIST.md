Your OSM Dashboard is ready for Railway deployment! Here's what was prepared:

## 📦 Files Created/Updated

- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Added `gunicorn==21.2.0` for production server
- ✅ `Procfile` - Tells Railway how to start your app
- ✅ `railway.toml` - Railway configuration
- ✅ `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.11.7
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from git
- ✅ `app.py` - Updated to use `PORT` environment variable
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- ✅ `start.sh` - Local development script (Mac/Linux)
- ✅ `start.ps1` - Local development script (Windows)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Initialize Git Repository** (if not already done)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - OSM Dashboard ready for Railway"
```

### 2. **Create GitHub Repository**

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository (e.g., "osm-dashboard")
3. **Don't** initialize with README (you already have files)

### 3. **Push to GitHub**

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. **Deploy to Railway**

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Click **"Start a New Project"**
4. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. Authorize Railway to access GitHub
6. Select your repository
7. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes)
8. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect Python/Flask
   - Install dependencies
   - Start with Gunicorn
   - Generate a public URL

### 5. **Get Your Live URL**

1. In Railway dashboard, click your project
2. Go to **"Settings"** → **"Domains"**
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. Your app will be live at: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

## 🔧 Optional Configuration

### Update OSM OAuth Callback URL

If you're using OAuth login:

1. Go to https://www.openstreetmap.org/oauth2/applications
2. Edit your application
3. Update callback URL to: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/auth/callback`

### Add Environment Variables in Railway

1. Click on your project
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Add (if needed):
   ```
   OSM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   OSM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

## 📊 Monitoring

Railway Dashboard provides:
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Network usage
- **Deployments**: Deployment history

## 🔄 Updating Your App

After making changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push
```

Railway automatically redeploys! ✨

## 💰 Railway Pricing

- **Trial**: $5 credit (enough for 1 month of light usage)

- **Pro**: $20/month unlimited

Your dashboard should fit comfortably in the free trial!

## ✅ Verify Deployment

After deployment, test:
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Map view works
- [ ] List view shows changesets
- [ ] Atlas AI responds
- [ ] Filters work
- [ ] Notes can be created
- [ ] Teams can be created

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build fails?
- Check Railway logs
- Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies

### App crashes?
- Check Railway logs for Python errors
- Ensure all imports are in `requirements.txt`

### 404 errors?
- Make sure `templates/` and `static/` folders are in git
- Check `.gitignore` isn't excluding necessary files

### Session issues?
- Railway's filesystem is ephemeral
- Sessions might reset on redeploy
- Consider using Redis for production sessions
