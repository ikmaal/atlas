## How It Works

The dashboard uses the OpenStreetMap API to fetch changesets for the Singapore bounding box:
- Latitude: 1.15° to 1.48° N
- Longitude: 103.59° to 104.05° E
- Time range: Past 365 days (1 year)

Changesets are fetched and displayed with:
- User information
- Number of changes (added, modified, deleted)
- Comments and descriptions
- Timestamp
- Map visualization
- Top contributors statistics
- **Validation status** (valid/warning/suspicious)

## Validation System

The dashboard automatically validates changesets to detect suspicious patterns:

### Validation Levels:
- **✓ Valid** (Green): Normal changesets
- **⚡ Warning** (Yellow): Changesets with elevated activity
  - 500-1000 total changes
  - 200-500 deletions
  - 80%+ deletion ratio (for changesets >50 changes)
- **⚠️ Suspicious** (Red, pulsing): High-risk changesets
  - 1000+ total changes
  - 500+ deletions
  - Multiple warning flags combined

### Detection Criteria:
- Very high edit counts
- Mass deletions
- High deletion ratios
- Automated imports/bots (flagged for awareness)
